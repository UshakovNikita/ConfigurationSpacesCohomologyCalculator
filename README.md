Take a complex $n$-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$ and delete all diagonals $z_i = z_j$. It is well-known that what remains is a $K(\pi, 1)$ space with the fundamental group isomorphic to the pure braid group $PB_n$:
	$$\{(z_1,\dots,z_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n \setminus (z_i=z_j) \} = K(PB_n,1)$$
This space can be interpreted as the configuration space $\ConfC{n}$ of $n$ ordered particles on the plane $\CC=\RR^2$.
